# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently pre-release and does not provide long-term support branches. The `main` branch is supported. After the initial public release, we will follow semantic versioning for stable releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately and responsibly.

- Email: security reports may be sent to `abasuri321@gmail.com`
- Include: a detailed description, steps to reproduce, affected versions/commit, and any proof-of-concept.
- Do not disclose publicly until we’ve had a reasonable time to investigate and release a fix.

## Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
- We aim to provide an initial evaluation within 10 business days.
- Fix timelines vary based on severity and complexity. Critical issues will be prioritized.

## Preferred Disclosure

Once a fix is available, we’ll publish a security advisory in the repository and acknowledge reporters who wish to be credited.

## Dependencies

We rely on upstream projects and libraries. If the vulnerability exists in a dependency, we’ll coordinate with maintainers where possible and track the fix via dependency updates.
